@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="We have also performed similar analysis in the infinite chain with translation invariance. Most of our main results (figure \ref {fig:full_optimal}) remains true. Since translation non-invariant system is easier to visualize the local operators and to directly compare with diffusive energy mode, here we present the results on the semi-infinite chain."}

@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="There are three widely used norms of an operator; the operator norm (largest absolute value of the operator), the trace norm ($\protect \mathrm  {tr(\protect \sqrt  {\protect \mathaccentV {hat}05E{O}\protect \mathaccentV {hat}05E{O}^\protect \dag  })}$), and the Frobenius norm ($\protect \sqrt  {\protect \mathrm  {tr(\protect \mathaccentV {hat}05E{O}\protect \mathaccentV {hat}05E{O}^\protect \dag  )}}$). Each norm has its own meaning. Although the operator norm is physically the most relevant one for our purpose, we choose the Frobenius norm since it is the easiest to numerically optimize. See supplementary material for details of the relevance of the operator norm."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="To make this conjecture precise, given a quantum circuit of bounded range $R$ (so that the circuit acting on an operator increases the support by at most $R$), and given a set $X$ define an super-operator $E_X(O)$ by $E_X(O)=tr_{Y \setminus X} (2O-U_Y O U_Y^\dagger -U_Y^\dagger O U_Y)*Z^{-1}$, where the set $Y$ is any set chosen large enough to contain all sites within distance $R$ of site $X$, where the normalization $Z$ is chosen so that $_X(I)=I$, and where the unitary $U_Y$ is the unitary obtained from the quantum circuit restricted to set Y in the natural way (i.e., one includes only gates in the quantum circuit which are supported in $Y$). Let $\lambda (X)$ denote the second smallest eigenvalue of $E_X$. Then, we conjecture that for any infinite hypercubic lattice and any circuit with bounded Hilbert space dimension on each site, that $\lambda (B(R,i))$ tends to zero are $R$ tends to infinity, where $B(R,i)$ is the set of sites within distance $R$ of any site $i$."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note5,key="Note5",note="When $M\rightarrow \infty $, $\protect \mathaccentV {hat}05E{A}_M$ can be a projection onto an eigenstate of Hamiltonian so it commutes with $H$."}
